# Skatejs Web Components

This repo gives you the bare minimum you'd need in an environment that doesn't support Custom Elements or Shadow DOM natively. It gives you support for the V1 APIs of each respectively and ensures all their polyfill dependencies are met.

To include simply:

```js
import 'skatejs-web-components';
```

Or if you're kickin it old-school:

```js
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/skatejs-web-components"></script>
```
